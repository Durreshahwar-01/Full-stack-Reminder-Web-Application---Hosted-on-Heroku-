# Full-stack-Reminder-Web-Application---Hosted-on-Heroku-


The application that I have developed is a Web application for Reminders. The site consists of many services that will allow users to input and store reminders for their daily tasks. The first service allows users to verbally speak their reminder into a textbox and easily control the device and reminders by speaking on the click of a button. A speech API was used to handle voice data.	The second service allows users to manually fill out a form for a reminder. This service requires input fields of for date, topic and body message for the reminder. The reminder is submitted by clicking a button and a pop up with the reminder confirmation appears on the screen. The reminder is then sent and stored into a database storage service – Firebase which is a NoSQL database program in real-time, built on Google’s infrastructure. Every time a user inputs a new reminder the database is automatically updated.  In order to accomplish this web application, I used HTML and CSS to design and provide structure for the web page, JavaScript and jQuery to add functionality to the buttons to receive input from users and a speech API to allow users to verbally say their reminder to the site. In order to store the reminders, I used Firebase as a storage service and connected Firebase to the web application.
